1,"Okay, thanks again for taking the time to chat with me. I know leaving a job is a big decision, and your feedback is really valuable to us.

So, just to get started, could you tell me a little about what ultimately led to your decision to leave the company? Knowing your reasoning helps us understand where we can improve.",for better opportunities

4,Were the salary and benefits competitive with similar roles you've had or researched?,no no
5,"Okay. Before we move on, I just want to make sure I understand. You mentioned earlier you left for ""better opportunities."" Was the main driver for that the compensation and benefits package here, or were there other factors at play? Understanding the relative importance of each factor helps us prioritize improvements.",paisa hi nahin dete hain
6,"Perhaps I can ask it this way: Did you feel valued for the work you did here? Did you receive praise, promotions, or other forms of recognition for your contributions?","Sorry, I didn't catch that."
7,"If you didn't receive formal recognition, did you at least feel that your efforts were acknowledged informally? For instance, did your manager or team members express gratitude for your work?","Sorry, I didn't catch that."
8,"What aspects of the job did you find most enjoyable, and what aspects did you find least enjoyable?",trash trash trash company trash
9,"Okay, I understand you may not want to go into specifics. That's alright.

Given your experience, how likely are you to recommend this organization as a place to work to your friends or former colleagues? On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being ""not at all likely"" and 10 being ""very likely,"" what number would you choose?","Sorry, I didn't catch that."
10,"Okay. Given your experiences, it sounds like it might be closer to a 1 than a 10.

To get a better understanding of what went wrong, did you share any of your concerns with the company before deciding to leave? For example, did you speak with your manager or HR about your concerns regarding compensation, recognition, or anything else?",i don't know
11,"Perhaps a different way to put it is: what would have made this a better place to work for you, beyond just the pay? Were there issues with the work itself, the management, the team, or anything else that contributed to your decision to leave?",more resources
12,"Okay. Let's move on. Thinking about your direct supervisor, how satisfied were you with your manager's treatment of you?",on a scale of 1 to 10 i was 7 out of 10 satisfied

Did you receive frequent, constructive feedback from your manager and peers?","Sorry, I didn't catch that."
14,"How often did you typically receive feedback? Was it a formal process, like regular performance reviews, or more informal, like on-the-spot comments and suggestions?","Sorry, I didn't catch that."
15,"Okay, I'll take that as you didn't get much feedback.

Thinking about your overall experience working for this company, how happy were you in general?",very happy
